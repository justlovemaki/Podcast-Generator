# üéôÔ∏è Simple Podcast Generator

> Easily transform your ideas into lively and engaging multi-person conversational podcasts with a single click!
> [‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](README.md)

This is a powerful script tool that leverages the intelligence of **OpenAI API** to generate insightful podcast scripts and transforms cold text into warm audio through **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** API services. You just need to provide a topic, and it handles the rest!

‚ú® The podcast script generation logic of this project is deeply inspired by the [SurfSense](https://github.com/MODSetter/SurfSense) project. We express our sincere gratitude for its open-source contribution!

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

### üìù Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.x**
    *   Please ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

2.  **FFmpeg**
    *   This project relies on FFmpeg for audio merging. Please visit the [FFmpeg official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) to download and install it.
    *   **Important**: After installation, please ensure the `ffmpeg` command is added to your system's environment variable (PATH) so that the script can call it normally.

### üêç Python Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and install the required Python libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install requests openai pydub msgpack
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Input Files

Before running, please ensure the following files are ready:

*   `input.txt`: Enter the **podcast topic** or core ideas you wish to discuss in this file.
*   `prompt/prompt-overview.txt`: A system prompt used to guide AI in generating the **overall outline** of the podcast.
*   `prompt/prompt-podscript.txt`: A system prompt used to guide AI in generating the **detailed dialogue script**. It contains dynamic placeholders (e.g., `{{numSpeakers}}`, `{{turnPattern}}`), which the script will automatically replace.

### 2. Configure TTS Service and Roles

*   The `config/` directory contains your TTS configuration files (e.g., `edge-tts.json`). This file defines the TTS service's API interface, podcast roles (`podUsers`), and their corresponding voices (`voices`).

### 3. Run the Script

Execute the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
python podcast_generator.py [Optional Parameters]
```

#### **Optional Parameters**

*   `--api-key <YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>`: Your OpenAI API key. If not provided, it will be read from the configuration file or the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
*   `--base-url <YOUR_OPENAI_BASE_URL>`: Proxy address for the OpenAI API. If not provided, it will be read from the configuration file or the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable.
*   `--model <OPENAI_MODEL_NAME>`: Specify the OpenAI model to use (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`). The default value is `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
*   `--threads <NUMBER_OF_THREADS>`: Specify the number of parallel threads for audio generation (default is `1`), improving processing speed.

#### **Run Example**

```bash
# Use gpt-4o model and 4 threads to generate the podcast
python podcast_generator.py --api-key sk-xxxxxx --model gpt-4o --threads 4
```

### 4. Custom AI Prompts (`custom` code block)

To provide more detailed AI instructions or add specific context, you can embed `custom` code blocks in the `input.txt` file. The content of this code block will serve as additional instructions, built into the core prompt (`prompt-podscript.txt`) for podcast script generation, thereby influencing the AI's generation behavior.

**Usage**:
In any location within the `input.txt` file, define your custom content using the following format:

```
```custom-begin
Additional instructions or context you wish to provide to the AI, for example:
- "Please ensure the discussion includes an in-depth analysis of [specific concept]."
- "Please add some humorous elements to the dialogue, especially jokes about [a certain topic]."
- "All character speeches must be concise, and each sentence should not exceed two lines."
```custom-end
```

**Effect**:
All text content within the `custom` code block (excluding the `custom-begin` and `custom-end` tags themselves) will be extracted and appended to the processed content of the [`prompt/prompt-podscript.txt`](prompt/prompt-podscript.txt) template. This means that these custom instructions will directly influence the AI's decisions and style when generating specific podcast dialogue scripts, helping you to control the output more precisely.

**Example Scenario**:
If you want the AI to particularly emphasize the future development of a certain technological trend when discussing a tech topic, you can add this to `input.txt`:

```
```custom-begin
Please foresightedly analyze the disruptive changes AI might bring in the next five years, and mention the potential impact of quantum computing on existing encryption technologies.
```custom-end
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File Details (`config/*.json`)

The configuration file is the "brain" of the entire project, telling the script how to work with AI and TTS services.

```json
{
  "podUsers": [
    {
      "code": "zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural",
      "role": "‰∏ªÊåÅ‰∫∫"
    },
    {
      "code": "zh-CN-YunxiNeural",
      "role": "ÊäÄÊúØ‰∏ìÂÆ∂"
    }
  ],
  "voices": [
    {
      "name": "XiaoMin",
      "alias": "ÊôìÊïè",
      "code": "yue-CN-XiaoMinNeural",
      "locale": "yue-CN",
      "gender": "Female",
      "usedname": "ÊôìÊïè"
    },
    {
      "name": "YunSong",
      "alias": "‰∫ëÊùæ",
      "code": "yue-CN-YunSongNeural",
      "locale": "yue-CN",
      "gender": "Male",
      "usedname": "‰∫ëÊùæ"
    }
  ],
  "apiUrl": "http://localhost:5000/api/tts?text={{text}}&voiceCode={{voiceCode}}",
  "turnPattern": "random"
}
```

*   `podUsers`: Defines the **roles** in the podcast. The `code` for each role must correspond to a valid voice in the `voices` list.
*   `tts_max_retries` (optional): The maximum number of retries when a TTS API call fails (default is `3`).
*   `voices`: Defines all available TTS **voices**, which can include `volume_adjustment` (volume adjustment in dB, e.g., `6.0` to increase by 6dB, `-3.0` to decrease by 3dB) and `speed_adjustment` (speed adjustment in percentage, e.g., `10.0` to increase speed by 10%, `-10.0` to decrease speed by 10%) parameters.
*   `voices`: Defines all available TTS **voices**.
*   `apiUrl`: Your TTS service API endpoint. `{{text}}` will be replaced with the dialogue text, and `{{voiceCode}}` will be replaced with the character's voice code.
*   `turnPattern`: Defines the **turn-taking pattern** for character dialogue, such as `random` or `sequential`.

### `tts_providers.json` File Description

The `tts_providers.json` file is used to store authentication information for various TTS service providers, such as API keys. This file is used in the following scenarios:

1. In the various TTS service test scripts in the `check/` directory, to obtain the corresponding authentication information
2. In the `podcast_generator.py` script, to obtain additional configuration parameters for specific TTS services

The structure of this file is as follows:
```json
{
  "index": {
        "api_key": null
  },
  "edge": {
        "api_key": null
  },
  "doubao": {
        "X-Api-App-Id": "null",
        "X-Api-Access-Key": "null"
  },
  "fish": {
        "api_key": "null"
  },
  "minimax": {
        "group_id": "null",
        "api_key": "null"
  },
  "gemini": {
        "api_key": "null"
  }
}
```

Notes:
*   In actual use, please replace `"null"` with the corresponding authentication information
*   `tts_providers-local.json` is a local configuration file example that contains actual authentication information (please do not commit this file to version control systems)
