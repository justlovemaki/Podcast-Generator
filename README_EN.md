# üéôÔ∏è Simple Podcast Generator

> Easily transform your ideas into lively and engaging multi-person dialogue podcasts with one click!
> [‰∏≠ÊñáÁâàÊú¨](README.md)

This is a powerful script tool that leverages the wisdom of **OpenAI API** to generate insightful podcast scripts, and through **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** API services, transforms cold text into warm audio. You just need to provide a topic, and leave the rest to it!

‚ú® The podcast script generation logic of this project is deeply inspired by the [SurfSense](https://github.com/MODSetter/SurfSense) project. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to their open-source contributions!

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

### üìù Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.x**
    *   Please ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

2.  **FFmpeg**
    *   This project depends on FFmpeg for audio merging. Please visit the [FFmpeg official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) to download and install.
    *   **Important Note**: After installation, please ensure the `ffmpeg` command has been added to your system's environment variables (PATH) so that the script can call it normally.

### üêç Python Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and install the required Python libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install requests openai pydub msgpack
```

> **Dependency Explanation**:
> - `requests`: Used to send HTTP requests to TTS service APIs
> - `openai`: Used to interact with OpenAI API to generate podcast scripts
> - `pydub`: Used for audio processing, such as adjusting volume and speed
> - `msgpack`: Used for efficient data serialization with certain TTS services (such as Fish Audio)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Input Files

Before running, please ensure the following files are ready:

*   `input.txt`: Enter your **podcast topic** or core idea in this file.
*   `prompt/prompt-overview.txt`: System prompt used to guide AI in generating the podcast **overall outline**.
*   `prompt/prompt-podscript.txt`: System prompt used to guide AI in generating **detailed dialogue scripts**. It contains dynamic placeholders (such as `{{numSpeakers}}`, `{{turnPattern}}`), which the script will automatically replace.

### 2. Configure TTS Services and Characters

*   TTS configuration files (such as `edge-tts.json`) are stored in the `config/` directory. This file defines the TTS service API interface, podcast characters (`podUsers`) and their corresponding voices (`voices`).

### 3. Run the Script

Execute the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
python podcast_generator.py [optional parameters]
```

#### **Optional Parameters**

*   `--api-key <YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>`: Your OpenAI API key. If not provided, it will be read from the configuration file or `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
*   `--base-url <YOUR_OPENAI_BASE_URL>`: Proxy address of the OpenAI API. If not provided, it will be read from the configuration file or `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable.
*   `--model <OPENAI_MODEL_NAME>`: Specify the OpenAI model to use (such as `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`). Default value is `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
*   `--threads <NUMBER_OF_THREADS>`: Specify the number of parallel threads for audio generation (default is `1`) to improve processing speed.
*   `--output-language <LANGUAGE_CODE>`: Specify the output language of the podcast script (default is `Chinese`).
*   `--usetime <TIME_DURATION>`: Specify the time length of the podcast script (default is `10 minutes`).

#### **Running Example**

```bash
# Use gpt-4o model, edge-tts service and 4 threads to generate podcast
python podcast_generator.py --api-key sk-xxxxxx --model gpt-4o --tts-provider edge --threads 4
```

### 5. Using Web API (main.py)

This project also provides a FastAPI-based web service that allows you to generate podcasts through HTTP requests.

#### Start Web Service

```bash
python main.py
```

By default, the service will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

#### API Endpoints

1. **Generate Podcast** - `POST /generate-podcast`
   - Parameters:
     - `api_key`: OpenAI API key
     - `base_url`: OpenAI API base URL (optional)
     - `model`: OpenAI model name (optional)
     - `input_txt_content`: Input text content
     - `tts_providers_config_content`: TTS provider configuration content
     - `podUsers_json_content`: Podcast user JSON configuration
     - `threads`: Number of threads (optional, default is 1)
     - `tts_provider`: TTS provider name (optional, default is "index-tts")

2. **Get Podcast Generation Status** - `GET /podcast-status`
   - Requires `X-Auth-Id` header

3. **Download Podcast** - `GET /download-podcast/`
   - Parameters:
     - `file_name`: Name of the file to download

4. **Get Voice List** - `GET /get-voices`
   - Parameters:
     - `tts_provider`: TTS provider name (optional, default is "tts")

#### API Usage Example

```bash
# After starting the service, use curl to send a request to generate podcast
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate-podcast" \
  -H "X-Auth-Id: your-auth-id" \
  -F "api_key=sk-xxxxxx" \
  -F "model=gpt-4o" \
  -F "input_txt_content=The future development of artificial intelligence" \
  -F "tts_providers_config_content={\"index\": {\"api_key\": \"your-api-key\"}}" \
  -F "podUsers_json_content=[{\"code\":\"zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural\",\"role\":\"Host\"}],\"voices\":[{\"name\":\"Xiaoxiao\",\"code\":\"zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural\"}]" \
  -F "threads=4" \
  -F "tts_provider=index-tts"
```

### 4. Customizing AI Prompts (`custom` code block)

To provide more detailed AI instructions or add specific context, you can embed `custom` code blocks in the `input.txt` file. The content in this code block will be used as additional instructions, built into the core prompt for podcast script generation (`prompt-podscript.txt`), thereby influencing the AI's generation behavior.

**Usage**:
In the `input.txt` file, define your custom content anywhere using the following format:

```
```custom-begin
Additional instructions or context you want to provide to the AI, for example:
- "Please ensure the discussion includes an in-depth analysis of [specific concept]."
- "Please add some humor to the conversation, especially jokes about [a certain topic]."
- "All characters' speeches must be brief, with each sentence not exceeding two lines."
```custom-end
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File Details

### `config/[tts-provider].json` (TTS Character and Voice Configuration)

This is your core TTS configuration file, with the filename corresponding to the provider specified by the `--tts-provider` parameter. It tells the script how to work with the TTS service.

```json
{
  "podUsers": [
    {
      "code": "zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural",
      "role": "Host"
    },
    {
      "code": "zh-CN-YunxiNeural",
      "role": "Tech Expert"
    }
  ],
  "voices": [
    {
      "name": "XiaoMin",
      "code": "yue-CN-XiaoMinNeural",
      "volume_adjustment": 1.0, 
      "speed_adjustment": 5.0
    }
  ],
  "apiUrl": "http://localhost:5000/api/tts?text={{text}}&voiceCode={{voiceCode}}",
  "turnPattern": "random",
  "tts_max_retries": 3
}
```

*   `podUsers`: Defines the **characters** in the podcast. Each character's `code` must correspond to a valid voice in the `voices` list.
*   `voices`: Defines all available TTS **voices**.
    *   `volume_adjustment` (optional): Volume adjustment (dB). For example, `6.0` increases volume by 6dB.
    *   `speed_adjustment` (optional): Speed adjustment (%). For example, `10.0` increases speed by 10%.
*   `apiUrl`: Your TTS service API endpoint. `{{text}}` and `{{voiceCode}}` are placeholders.
*   `turnPattern`: Defines the **turn-taking mode** for character dialogue, such as `random` (random) or `sequential` (sequential).
*   `tts_max_retries` (optional): Maximum number of retries when TTS API calls fail (default is `3`).

### `config/tts_providers.json` (TTS Provider Authentication)

This file is used to centrally manage authentication information (such as API keys) for all TTS service providers.

```json
{
  "index": { "api_key": null },
  "edge": { "api_key": null },
  "doubao": { "X-Api-App-Id": "null", "X-Api-Access-Key": "null" },
  "fish": { "api_key": "null" },
  "minimax": { "group_id": "null", "api_key": "null" },
  "gemini": { "api_key": "null" }
}
```
**Note**: In actual use, please replace `"null"` with valid authentication information. You can create a `tts_providers-local.json` to store real keys, which has been ignored by `.gitignore`.
